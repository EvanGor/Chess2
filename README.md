This was my final project for CS151 at UChicago. It was my first experience programming, and I remember it being a ton of work, but also super rewarding when I finally managed to get the gui running. I imagine that this code would be a pain in the butt to debug.

Running `chess-gui.rkt` in [Dr. Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/) will begin a game of chess.
